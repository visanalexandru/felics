# A new lossless image format based on FELICS 

## Introduction

[TODO]

In this paper, I will describe a new image format with lossless compression that is very simple yet efficient. My plan is to use FELICS [6](Howard & Vitter, 2002) as a method of compressing grayscale images. I will then generalize this method to also ompress RGB images and add support for both 8-bit and 16-bit pixel depths.

In the end, there should be a specification for the new image format, tools to convert from other image formats to the new format and backward, and a library that allows users to compress/decompress images from their code.


## Preliminaries

### Data compression 

Data compression is the process of reducing the number of bits required to encode information.
It is particularly useful for reducing storage costs and enables transmission over limited bandwith channels. 
Data compression can be lossless or lossy. 

As the name suggests, lossless compression allows the reconstruction of data from the compressed data without losing any information. Lossless compression is often used when no difference between the original data and the reconstructed data is tolerated [1](Sayood, 2006, p. 4).  

On the other hand, data that has been compressed using lossy compression cannot be reconstructed exactly. This may not be a problem in some applications. For example, a small quality loss when reconstructing audio files may be tolerated by a human listener. 

### Image compression 

Image compression refers to data compression applied to digital images. 
Images carry a huge amount of information and can occupy a significant amount of disk space. 

On the internet, they also take up to 65% of most webpages [2](Compression Techniques, n.d.). Therefore, good image compression algorithms can speed up page rendering, reduce bandwitdh and save battery life for mobile devices. 

There are both lossless and lossy methods of compressing images. Lossy image compression might be unsuitable for a number of tasks like medical imaging [3](Wong et al., 1995), satelite imagery and scientific illustrations and diagrams.
This paper will focus on a lossless compression scheme.

### What makes images compressible

[TODO]

### File formats

A file format defines how data inside a file is  arranged. This includes things like how text characters are encoded, or how audio is stored as digital waveforms. An image format is a file format for a digital image.

The image format dictates how pixels are stored in a file. Image data can be stored compressed or uncompressed. Examples of popular image formats are: PNG, JFIF, WEBP, QOI, BMP and TIFF.

Image formats may use lossless or lossy compression. 
For example, the PNG standard specifies that the compression should preserve all information [4](Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition), n.d.). JFIF, on the other hand, uses JPEG compression, which can be either lossless or lossy.

### Codes 

In information theory, a code refers to a system of mapping symbols or strings of symbols to codewords, where each codeword is a string of bits. For text data, symbols may be individual characters like letters, numbers and punctuation. For image data, symbols could represent individual pixels in an image.

Using codes, we can map any information into a bitstring. The length of the bitstring depends on the quality of the code and the probabilities of the individual symbols [5].
For example, the ASCII code uses the same number of bits to encode each symbol. If we know that some symbols occur more often, we may use a code that assigns shorter codewords to the common symbols and longer codewords to the rare symbols so that on average, messages use fewer bits. 

In this paper, we will use two types of codes: Golomb-Rice codes and Phased-In codes.

#### Golomb-Rice codes

Golomb codes are a type of code specifically suited for integers where larger values have a lower probability of occurence [7]. More specifically, Golomb codes work best when the source alphabet follows a geometric distribution. They have a tunable parameter $M$ that can be adjusted so that the code better matches the specific probability distribution of the integers in our data. 

The next figure shows the golomb bitwords generated for integers in $[0, 14]$, using $M = 4$. The geometric distribution used has $p = 0.4$. 

![](./figures/golomb.png)

Rice codes are a sub-category of Golomb codes in which the constraint $M = 2^K$ is added, so $M$ must be a power of two. Rice codes are more convenient for use on a computer, since we can use binary arithmetic for fast encoding and decoding.

To encode an integer, we first remove its $K$ least significant bits and encode the remaining number in unary. Then, we simply output its $K$ least significant bits directly.

#### Phased-In codes

Unlike Golomb-Rice codes, Phased-In codes were developed to encode data where individual symbols have equal probabilities. The issue with assigning bitwords of length $\lceil log_2n\rceil$ for symbols of an alphabet of size $n$ is that some codewords will not be used. For example, if $n=100$, we may assign each symbol a codeword of size $\lceil log_2n\rceil = 7$, but we will only use 100 out of 128 codewords. 

The solution described in [8] splits the $n$ symbols into two sets. If $2^m<=n < 2^m+1$, the first set will receive codewords of size $m+1$, and the second set codewords of size $m$. We denote them with $A$ and $B$. Their sizes will be computed like so:

$$
|A| =  2*n-2^{m+1} , |B| =  2^{m+1} - n
$$

Notice that $n = |A| + |B|$, so the two sets cover the entire alphabet. It's important to note that the average codeword length will be between $m$ and $m+1$ bits, so codewords will be shorter on average, especialy when there are more short codewords.

We will look now look at an example where we want to encode integers in the range $[0, 27)$. There are 27 integers, so $n=27$. We calculate $m$ to be $\lfloor log_227 \rfloor = 4$. Therefore, $|A| = 2*27 - 2^5 = 22$, $|B| = 2^5 - 27 = 5$ 
Integers in the range $[0, 5)$ will receive codewords of size 4, while integers in the range $[5, 27)$ will receive codewords of size 5.


The following table shows the codewords of the integers in the range $[0, 27)$.

| Integer | Codeword | Integer | Codeword | Integer | Codeword | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0000 | 10 | 11101 | 20 | 00111
| 1   | 1000 | 11 | 00010 | 21 | 10110
| 2   | 0100 | 12 | 00011 | 21 | 10111
| 3   | 1100 | 13 | 10010 | 23 | 01110
| 4   | 0010 | 14 | 10011 | 24 | 01111
| 5   | 10100 | 15 | 01010 | 25 | 11110
| 6   | 10101 | 16 | 01011 | 26 | 11111
| 7   | 01100 | 17 | 11010 | 
| 8   | 01101 | 18 | 11011 |
| 9   | 11100 | 19 | 00110 |

### FELICS 

FELICS, which stands for "fast and efficient lossless image compression system", works by modeling the distribution of a pixel's intensity value using the values of its two nearest neighbours that have already been visited. 

FELICS proceeds by coding pixels their in raster-scan order. This means that FELICS traverses the image line by line, from the left to the right. Therefore, the two nearest neighbours of a pixel are usually the one above and the one to the left of the current pixel. 

![neighbour-figure](./figures/neighbours.png)

*Figure shows the various possible configurations for the neighbouring pixels (A and B) of a given pixel (X)*

In the context of a grayscale image, each pixel has a single intensity value, $V$. For images with multiple channels, each pixel may be represented by multiple intensity values. For example, an RGB image has three channels: red, green and blue. We can think of a pixel as a triplet $(R, G ,B)$, with an intensity value for each channel.
Since the algorithm only works for grayscale images, a pixel will only have one intensity value. 

To encode a pixel $P$, the algorithm looks at the two neighbouring pixels and their intensities. The smaller neighbouring value is called $L$, and the larger value $H$. Next, we compute $\Delta = H - L$, the prediction context of $P$. The coding proceeds as follows:

<pre>
if  L <= P <= H    
    use one bit to encode IN-RANGE 
    encode the value P - L in the range [0, Î”] using a truncated binary code 
if P < L
    use one bit to encode OUT-OF-RANGE
    use one bit to encode BELOW-RANGE 
    encode the value L-P-1 using Golomb-Rice codes 
if P > H
    use one bit to encode OUT-OF-RANGE
    use one bit to encode ABOVE-RANGE 
    encode the value P-H-1 using Golomb-Rice codes 
</pre>

The first two pixels in the image are outputed without coding. The steps above are then repeated for every pixel in the image, in raster-scan order.

The algorithm assumes that if a pixel $P$ is in the range $[L, H]$, its value follows a uniform distribution. Conversely, if $P$ is out-of-range, its value must follow a geometric distribution. These assumptions are why we use Golomb-Rice and Phased-in codes to encode pixel intensities. 

We can understand why these assumptions where made by analyzing the distribution of intensities of pixels for each context $\Delta$. Intensities are generally distributed as shown in the next figure.

In-Range intensities can be modeled using a uniform distribution without a significant overhead in bitword length, so Phased-In codes are used. Because there is a small crest in the middle, we assign the shorter codewords to the values near the middle of the interval $[L, H]$. The probability of out-of-range intensities falls of sharply the further we move away from the interval $[L, H]$ so it is reasonable to use Golomb-Rice codes.

### Reversible color transform

Digital images often store color information using multiple channels. Usually, each pixel holds three color values: red, green and blue, denoting a coordinate in the RGB color space. We can compress an RGB image by applying a grayscale compression algorithm on each channel independently, but this is not efficient for natural images. It has been shown [9] that the RGB color space exhibits a high statistical corelation between the color components.
We can exploit this by mapping the image from the RGB color space into a space in which the components are uncorrelated. 

We want to achieve losless image compression, so the color transform needs to be lossless too. A good solution is described in [10], which introduces the YCoCg color space.
The linear operation that maps coordinates in the RGB space to coordinates in the YCoCg space is defined as follows:

```math
\begin{bmatrix} Y \\ Co \\ Cg \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1/4 & 1/2 & 1/4 \\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 &0 \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix} R \\ G \\ B \end{bmatrix}
```

The inverse of this operation is defined as follows:

```math
\begin{bmatrix} R \\ G \\ B \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1/4 & 3/4 \\1 &-1/4&-1/4\\ 1 &3/4&-1/4\end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix} R \\ G \\ B \end{bmatrix}
```

We can also use the lifting tehnique described in [10] to make the transform lossless.

## My contribution 

Building on the theoretical foundation laid out in the previous chapter, this chapter delves into the technical issue of implementing the new image format. I will describe how these techniques come together to make it all work.  

[TODO: insert summary]

### Choosing the right programming language

Data compression is a usually a computationally intensive task, so we would like to implement our image format using a language that is fast. The C programming language is a good example of a low-level language that provides the means to writing fast compression algorithms because it is compiled ahead of time and allows us to manually manage allocated memory. More control over the memory layout can be beneficial for cache locality[10].  
A downside of the C programming language is that it's potentially memory unsafe. It allows arbitrary pointer arithmetic and does not have bounds checking. 

The lack of bounds checking when accessing memory presents a significant security risk. This is particularly exploited in the context of data compression, where malicious actors can craft data specifically designed to trigger buffer overflows during the process of encoding or decoding.

For example, a bug in the library "libwebp" allowed an attacker to create a malformed WebP file that contained an invalid Huffman tree [11]. This lead to a heap buffer overlow, making it possible to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

A better choice is the Rust programming language. Like C, it compiles ahead of time so the compiler can emit optimized code that runs fast. Moreover, the rust compiler refuses to compile any code that contains memory-related bugs. For these reasons, I chose to implement the image format using the Rust programming language.

### Project structure

When implementing an image format, the project is usually split up into two parts: a library that exports important functions used in reading and writing to and from image files, and a set of tools that use the library to implement basic functionalities. 
For example, the open source library to use in applications that create, read, and manipulate PNG image files is called "libpng"[13]. The library is developed alongside many tools like:

- "pnm2png" - Program that is used to convert a "pnm" file to a "png" file.
- "png2pnm" - Program that is used to convert a "png" file to a "pnm" file.
- "cvtcolor" - Program that converts images from a format to another given format (for example grayscale to RGB).

Examples of functions provided in the "libpng" library are:

- "png_read_png" - For reading the entire image into memory.
- "png_read_info" - For reading only the file information.
- "png_write_image" - For writing the image from memory.


My project will be structured similarly, the objective being to create a Rust package that contains a library crate and multiple binary crates implementing programs that use the library.
