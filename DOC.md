# A new lossless image compression format based on FELICS 

## Introduction

### Data compression 

Data compression is the process of reducing the number of bits required to encode information.
It is particularly useful for reducing storage costs and enables transmission over limited bandwith channels. 
Data compression can be lossless or lossy. 

As the name suggests, lossless compression allows the reconstruction of data from the compressed data without losing any information. Lossless compression is often used when no difference between the original data and the reconstructed data is tolerated [1](Sayood, 2006, p. 4).  

On the other hand, data that has been compressed using lossy compression cannot be reconstructed exactly. This may not be a problem in some applications. For example, a small quality loss when reconstructing audio files may be tolerated by a human listener. 

### Image compression 

Image compression refers to data compression applied to digital images. 
Images carry a huge amount of information and can occupy a significant amount of disk space. 

On the internet, they also take up to 65% of most webpages [2](Compression Techniques, n.d.). Therefore, good image compression algorithms can speed up page rendering, reduce bandwitdh and save battery life for mobile devices. 

There are both lossless and lossy methods of compressing images. Lossy image compression might be unsuitable for a number of tasks like medical imaging [3](Wong et al., 1995), satelite imagery and scientific illustrations and diagrams.
This paper will focus on a lossless compression scheme.

### File formats

A file format defines how data inside a file is  arranged. This includes things like how text characters are encoded, or how audio is stored as digital waveforms. An image format is a file format for a digital image.

The image format dictates how pixels are stored in a file. Image data can be stored compressed or uncompressed. Examples of popular image formats are: PNG, JFIF, WEBP, QOI, BMP and TIFF.

Image formats may use lossless or lossy compression. 
For example, the PNG standard specifies that the compression should preserve all information [4](Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition), n.d.). JFIF, on the other hand, uses JPEG compression, which can be either lossless or lossy.


## A new lossless image compression format

In this paper, we will describe a new lossless image compression format that is very simple yet efficient. We plan to use FELICS [5](Howard & Vitter, 2002) as a method of compressing grayscale images. We will then generalize this method to compress RGB images and add support for both 8-bit and 16-bit pixel depths.

In the end, we should have a specification for our new image format, tools to convert from other image formats to ours and backward, and a library that allows users to compress/decompress images from their code.

### FELICS  

FELICS, which stands for "fast and efficient lossless image compression system", works by modeling the distribution of a pixel's intensity value using the values of its two nearest neighbours that have already been visited. 

FELICS proceeds in raster-scan order, so the two nearest neighbours are usually the one above and the one to the left of the current pixel.
